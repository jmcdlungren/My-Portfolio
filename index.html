                <p class="About-p">
                    At my core, I'm driven by my faith and relationship with Jesus Christ first, and by my family, both blood and chosen, second. Among my family, one of my greatest inspirations is my fifth great grandfather, <a class="McDowell" href="http://mcdowellhouse.com/">Dr. Ephraim McDowell</a>, who I get my middle name from. The picture above is an engraving on his tomb in Danville, KY. Other inspirations in my family include my paternal grandfather who helped set up the original computer systems in several hospitals in Arizona, and my maternal grandparents who helped teach me the value of hard work and how to do business well.

                <p class="About-p">
                    Career-wise, I've been working customer service type roles since before I was 16, equating to over 14 years of experience. I was also in the mortgage banking world for the past 9 years prior to the downsizing of my team. Having been interested in the world of coding, I took the layoff as my sign to pursue a professional certification as a Full Stack Web Developer. I love being able to work things out and figuring out what I can do to make thinks "tick," with my sole vice previously being Excel spreadsheets. One of my long-term goals would be to eventually create a program and website for a budgeting tool that combines some great features that I currently enjoy through budgeting software programs such as Calendar Budget, YNAB, and Every Dollar.
                </p>
                
                <p class="About-p">
                    In the meantime, along with attending class for this 6-month long certification program, I also currently drive full time as an independent contractor partnering with platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and Veyo.
